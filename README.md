# Heart-Disease-prediction-using-machine-learning-technique-in-python
It's a complete software project and the language used is Python. 
We have made a GUI (Graphic User Interface) 
Overview of the project- The user has to enter the medical parameters that are required for heart disease prediction, after that users have to choose the models (Machine learning models) and then have to  click on Prediction button, after clicking the result is display whether the user have heart disease or not and Whichever the model is selected the models accuracy, precision, sensitivity, Recall and F1 Score(This are machine Learning technique) will display. The user can also check will other models too and can check the highest Accuracy Values. Then We came to know about online dataset. So we have used online dataset From Kaggle. Firstly we have imported all the necessary Libraries and then Train and test the dataset and fit the Machine learning models and taken the 5 Machine Learning technique which are Accuracy, Precision,Sensitivity, F1Score and recall values for each models. And then made GUI.
